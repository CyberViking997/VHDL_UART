# VHDL_UART

This is a simple UART module written in vhdl for a university course project.
(As soon as the project is completed, it will be linked here)


## Tests

The module was tested using modelsim and in the testbench file in the folder. This file generates 10 random 8-bit samples and inputs them to the transmission module. An eye analysis of the signals must be carried out to check that the results are correct.
